Learn to execute a successful GWAS experiment from design to analysis. This five-day online workshop will cover experimental design, data generation, and analysis on the command line. Participants will explore software and protocols, create and modify workflows, and diagnose/treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. Exercises will be performed on the command line with provided datasets.

To get the most out of this course, please complete the prerequisite material in [command line](base/cli_prerequisites) and [R](base/r_prerequisites) before the course, and contact us with any questions.
